      Wild Rydes has a dedicated staff that recruits, trains, and tends to our herd of unicorns. We take great pride in the quality of unicorns and rydes that we provide to our customers, and our staff exercises the utmost care in vetting the unicorns that join our herd.
    </p>

    <p class="content">
      Every unicorn goes through a rigorous due diligence process where we perform background checks, flying exams, and several rounds of interviews. Unicorns accepted to Wild Rydes are then treated to the best care and maintenance possible. We provide them excellent benefits, health care, and employee perks. This is part of our company philosophy in which happy unicorns lead to happy customers.
    </p>

    <p class="content">Meet our new friends and family members. Straight from Santa's workshop at the North Pole our newest members are known for delivering gifts to children all around the world every Christmas eve. Santa has decided that helping people throughout the rest of the year would be the best way for the reindeer to stay in shape and better reach and benefit society. While Santa apologizes for not being able to deliver lower gas prices for the good boys and girls around the world, his reindeer are more than happy to do what they can to make up for it. We appreciate and welcome them gladly.</p>

            Dasher gets his name because he is the fastest reindeer of the whole pack. He used to be lead reindeer but was replaced by Rudolph because he kept going too quickly and the rest of the group couldn’t keep up! He first caught Santa’s eye as a young calf when he challenged all of the older reindeer to a race and comfortably beat them all.

            The reindeer with the most flair and elegance, ever since Dancer could walk, all he wanted to do was dance.

            Just like his twin brother Dancer, Prancer is a supremely graceful and majestic reindeer, except he is all too aware of it. Every Christmas Eve, Santa Claus has to drag him away from preening himself in the mirror and polishing his horns to go and deliver the presents on time.
